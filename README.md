# Python Higher Level Programming

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding.  

In this proyect we will learn in debth about python and its application.  

## Python Scripts


- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the `holbertonschool-higher_level_programming` repo, containing a description of the repository
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `PEP 8` style (version `1.7.*`)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

_Beautiful is better than ugly._  
_Explicit is better than implicit._  
_Simple is better than complex._  
_Complex is better than complicated._  
_Flat is better than nested._  
_Sparse is better than dense._  
_Readability counts._  
_Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules._  
_Although practicality beats purity._  
_Errors should never pass silently._  
_Unless explicitly silenced._  
_In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess._  
_There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it._  
_Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch._  
_Now is better than never._  
_Although never is often better than *right* now._  
_If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea._  
_If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea._  
_Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!_
