### Tasks

_**0. Print a list of integers**_  
Write a function that prints all integers of a list.  

_**1. Secure access to an element in a list**_  
Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.  

_**2. Replace element**_  
Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).  

_**3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!**_  
Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.  

_**4. Replace in a copy**_  
Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).  

_**5. Can you C me now?**_  
Write a function that removes all characters `c` and `C` from a string.  

_**6. Lists of lists = Matrix**_  
Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.  

_**7. Tuples addition**_  
Write a function that adds 2 tuples.  

_**8. More returns!**_  
Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.  

_**9. Find the max**_  
Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.  

_**10. Only by 2**_  
Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.  

_**11. Delete at**_  
Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.  

_**12. Switch**_  
Complete the source code in order to switch value of `a` and `b`  

_**13. Linked list palindrome**_  
Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
