_**1. Number of lines**_  
Write a function that returns the number of lines of a text file.  

_**2. Read n lines**_  
Write a function that reads n lines of a text file (`UTF8`) and prints it to stdout.  

_**3. Write to a file**_  
Write a function that writes a string to a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters written.  

_**4. Append to a file**_  
Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added.  

_**5. To JSON string**_  
Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string).  

_**6. From JSON string to Object**_  
Write a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string.  

_**7. Save Object to a file**_  
Write a function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation.  

_**8. Create object from a JSON file**_  
Write a function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”.  

_**9. Load, add, save**_

_**11. Student to JSON**_  
Write a class `Student` that defines a student.  

_**12. Student to JSON with filter**_
